You are given a 0-indexed array of string words and two integers left and right.
A string is called a vowel string if it starts with a vowel character and ends with a vowel character where vowel characters are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'.
Return the number of vowel strings words[i] where i belongs to the inclusive range [left, right].
Example 1:
Input: words = ["are","amy","u"], left = 0, right = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: 
- "are" is a vowel string because it starts with 'a' and ends with 'e'.
- "amy" is not a vowel string because it does not end with a vowel.
- "u" is a vowel string because it starts with 'u' and ends with 'u'.
The number of vowel strings in the mentioned range is 2.

class Solution {
    public int vowelStrings(String[] words, int left, int right) {
        int count=0;
        for(int i=left;i<=right;i++){
            int s=words[i].charAt(0);
            int e=words[i].charAt(words[i].length()-1);
            if(s =='a' || s == 'e' || s=='i' || s=='o' || s=='u'){
                if(e =='a' || e == 'e' || e=='i' || e =='o' || e =='u'){
                count++;
            }
        }
        }
        return count;
    }
}

LOGIC:
-> first initialize count to store vowel count words.
-> run a for loop from left to right of a word
-> for a word string set sytart and end indexes and check if both equls to a,e,i,o,and u...if equal then increase the count and return count.
